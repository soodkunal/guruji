Lecture Structure:

Slide 1: Introduction
- Title: "Understanding Artificial Intelligence"
- Engage students by asking the question, "Who knows what Artificial Intelligence is?" 
- Briefly explain the objective of the lecture: "Today, we're going to learn about Artificial Intelligence, or AI, which is an exciting area in the field of computer science!"

Slide 2: What is AI?
- Title: "What is AI?" 
- Explain AI in simple terms: "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is about making machines smart. It's like teaching a robot to think and learn like a human."

Slide 3: Tasks AI Can Perform
- Title: "What Can AI Do?" 
- Discuss tasks that require human intelligence such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving, and how AI can perform these tasks.

Slide 4: AI and Data
- Title: "How Does AI Work?" 
- Explain the role of data in AI: "AI systems need to look at lots and lots of information, or 'data', to learn. They identify patterns in this data to make predictions."

Slide 5: Machine Learning
- Title: "Machine Learning (ML)" 
- Simplify the concept of ML: "Machine Learning is like a robot's school. By showing a robot lots of pictures of a cat, for example, the robot can learn to identify a cat by itself."

Slide 6: Deep Learning
- Title: "Deep Learning (DL)" 
- Simplify the concept of DL: "Deep Learning takes machine learning a step further. It's like a robot's university. It helps robots solve more complicated tasks, like understanding human speech or driving a car."

Slide 7: Conclusion
- Title: "AI in Our Lives" 
- Discuss how AI affects our daily lives and future: "From voice assistants like Siri to self-driving cars, AI is changing our world. And who knows? Maybe someday, you could be teaching a robot!"

Slide 8: Interactive Q&A
- Title: "Questions Time!" 
- Encourage an interactive Q&A session: "Now it's your turn to ask questions. What would you like to know about AI?"

Remember to use a simple, conversational tone, and use real-life examples that are relevant to the Indian context, such as referencing popular AI-enabled technologies like Siri or Google Assistant. Also, include images and graphics to visually explain concepts and engage students. At the end of the lecture, encourage an interactive Q&A session to clarify students' doubts and stimulate their curiosity.
